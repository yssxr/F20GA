Importing

Objects were imported to unreal as fbx files.

Issues faced

-Upon importing initially, some objects were broken and glitched out. Fixed this by inverting normals in blender and re importing

-Scale of the scene was abnormally huge in Unreal, so went back to blender to scaled down all the objects for a smoother process

-Constant crashes of the engine made me lose progress, so started saving very often to not have much loss upon crash.

-Had to redo the lightings in unreal

Texture

Used realisitc textures for most of the objects using Unreal Engine's Quixel. 

Animation

Consist of 4 sequences, the animation was created by panning the camera across the different objects in the room and ending it by having it in the angle of the reference source

Rendering video provided the frames which was edited using a video editing software (Adobe Premier Pro) and added suitable music to match the scene
