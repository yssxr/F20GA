My original models upon exporting from blender in the gltf format would not load/ break the OpenGL template. I have made a simpler model capturing the essence of my orignal model
I have baked the textures for the model, to use a single texture file to apply to the models.
All the materials used were image textures.
I have added W,A,S,D,K,O keys functionality to be able to pan around the model and rotate it.
Changed the scale setting so the model loads up in approriate scaling.
There is no interaction as such in the model.
